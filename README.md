In order to solve the problem of Traders and Businessmen who find it difficult to keep record of their receipts, I've built a Receipt book App which will help them to keep track of all their receipts at one destination.By using Azure technologies and firebase I built a Receipt book App which will be helping traders and merchants to track their receipts or bills. It will help them for future verification and to file for any government schemes.

This video demonstrates how this application works.I used firebase auth for registration, firestore for storing data and firebase storage for storing images. To manage this project azure devops is used. https://dev.azure.com/omerbinjavid28/Receipt%20Book There is the link for azure devops project.To build this project I used the Azure board which is an Azure tool to build the software and I used azure repo to pull the project in Azure cloud.The azure repo is connected to GitHub. You can see how I managed my project by using azure boards in azure board section and how I pulled my project for future testing and enhancement in azure repo section.From the above video u can see how the application functions and in azure devops link u can see  how I managed the project using azure.
